# PongAIV1
A pong game with an AI built into it

Use the left and right arrow keys to move

This is just pong game with an AI. I open it up with Chrome and it works fine. 
The point to this was to see if an AI could learn to be a better pong player after a few games. Turns out, it's super bad.
Right now it gathers all the data after 1 game and tries to learn / implement it. 
Obviously you're going to need more data (games) in order for the AI to kind of learn the game.
So, if you want to change how many games until the AI uses the data then go to Line 251 on the main.js and you can change 1 to [a number you pick].

I've merged a new model in python with the data points. You can run / implement it instead of using the javascript one.
